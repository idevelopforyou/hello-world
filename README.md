# hello-world,
My first ever repository,
i am currently undertaking professional retraining,
for many years i worked in hotels and restaurants around the world.
I have just started a training school to become a Full-Stack web developer,
it should take me about one year to claim a good level and a good job.
My second step will be to aim for software architect.
